### FAQ
#### Q: What's the point?
A: To provide a clean and simple starting point for any possible project, without including too much extra stuff. But mostly the `tsconfig.json` file.

#### Q: What's so special about the `tsconfig.json` file?
A: There's a ridiculous amount of options for the Typescript compiler, and I can't remember what all of them do. This config should include every possible option and a comment explaining what that option does.

#### Q: Soo... You did all of this really just to save a `tsconfig.json` file?
A: Yes. Yes i did.
