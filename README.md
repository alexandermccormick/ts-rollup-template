# Rollup & Typescript boilerplate
### A boilerplate config for rollup with typescript.

## What does it do?
The idea here is to create a pain-free and non-redundant js/glsl interface, to provide a basic boilerplate and some constants like mouse position or time and also some functions specifically for pixel plotting.
